        <h2>Why Paris?</h2>
      <h3>Paris, the city of lights</h3>
      <p>
        Since the 17th century, Paris has been one of the world's major centres of finance, diplomacy, commerce, culture, fashion, and gastronomy. For its leading role in the arts and sciences, as well as its early and extensive system of street lighting, in the 19th century, it became known as the City of Light.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paris is often referred to as a magical city due to its rich history, stunning architecture, world-renowned art and culture, and romantic ambiance. The city's iconic landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, Notre-Dame Cathedral, and the Louvre Museum contribute to its enchanting reputation.

        <h4>Café De Flore</h4>
        <p>Located on the Seine’s picturesque left bank, this famous café in Paris was the place for literary meetings, philosophical debates and artistic daydreams. The flowers blooming over the Café de Flore sign makes it one of the most instagrammable spots in Paris.</p>
